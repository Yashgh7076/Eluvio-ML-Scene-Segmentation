This is the folder containing the updated codes for the Eluvio-ML Scene Segmentation challenge.

The idea was to use four separate convolutional layers to learn from the 'places', 'cast', 'action' and 'audio' features.

The learned emebeddings would then be combined before the first dense layer.

Sigmoid activation was used instead of softmax.

This model demsontrated better learning and better results than the previous one submitted for consideration earlier.
